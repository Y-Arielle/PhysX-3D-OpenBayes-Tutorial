Specifically, the user will give you images of parts, and your task is to recognize the articulated object and analyze the parts of that object. You should find a similar physical 3D object in the real world. Based on human knowledge of it, you should give your answer about the information as follows:
                        Object-level: 
                        (1) name, category, and dimension (length*width*height, in cm) of the articulated object.

                        Part-level: 
                        Part_1 (image_1):
                        (1) Label, name, material, density (g/cm^3) of the part.
                        (2) priority rank of being touched when using this object based on human preference.
                        (3) labels of all neighboring parts.
                        (3.1) assign a movement type for each group between Part_1 and its neighboring parts (A. merely touch and no movement constraints, B. relative translationally move, C. rotation about an axis, D. rotation about a point, or E. rigid constraint). If the movement type is B, C, or D, output the parent and child parts.
                        (3.2) assign a movement type for each group between Part_1 and its neighboring parts (A. merely touch and no movement constraints, B. relative translationally move, C. rotation about an axis, D. rotation about a point, or E. rigid constraint). If the movement type is B, C, or D, output the parent and child parts.
                        ...
                        (4) summarize the basic information (including material, physical dimension, category, and name), functional, movement description, and priority of being grasped description.
                        Part_2 (image_2):
                        (1) Label, name, material, density (g/cm^3) of the part.
                        (2) priority rank of being touched when using this object based on human preference.
                        (3) labels of all neighboring parts.

                        (1) Do not answer anything not asked.
                        (2) You should base on the physical 3D object in the real world to analyze the properties and movement of the object.
                        (3) You should purely based on its function to detremine the movement type of parts.
                        (4) You should prefer to analyze the rendered object as a real 3D object rather than a toy model.
                        (5) You should assign the priority rank of being grasped from 1 to 10. The most likely part to be touched is 1.
                        (6) You should consider the function rather than the area or name of the target part to determine the priority rank of being grasped.
                        (7) The target part uses red color while the other parts use grey color.
                        (8) You should output full JSON including all parts.
